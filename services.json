The program achieves this through collaborative efforts that disseminate information, build leadership, and empower individuals to become active in the movement to improve the quality of life for LGBTQ families and friends. Below are issues that affect the LGBTQ community.\n\n-Affirmations Faith Alliance (AFA): an inter-faith initiative to build bridges between the LGBT and faith communities in Southeast Michigan. Program identifies welcoming and affirming congregations and faith leaders. \n-Older Adult Coalition: the LGBT Older Adult Coalition is a collaboration of people and organizations in Southeastern Michigan who are working to establish effective programs and services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults.\n-Allies: Affirmations is working to amass a base of ally supporters who are willing to speak up and out for the LGBTQ community, and to participate in life and activities both at the Center and within the larger LGBTQ community. Allies have continuously played an active role in supporting Affirmations mission, many continuing to serve in leadership roles as board members, staff and volunteers. \n-Anti-bullying: LGBTQ youth suffer from disproportionately high rates of suicide and homelessness. Bullying is a leading factor resulting in limiting the full potential of all youth. Currently there are no protections for LGBTQ youth in Michigan schools. \n-Get Out The Vote: encourage and promote the right of citizens to participate in the democratic process. The center provides resources for voter registration.\n-LGBT-Discrimination: Michigan currently has a ban on same-sex marriage. Help us identify people who are in favor of marriage equality. Come join us at Affirmations Action Nights, every Tuesday from 6-9 pm, to let citizens and representatives know that Michigan is an equal opportunity state.\n-Marriage Equality: All committed couples should have the freedom to marry in the state that they call home, and that includes same-sex couples in Michigan. The landscape for marriage is shifting rapidly.\n-Domestic Partnership Registry: this is a direct response to the Michigan Court of Appeals ruling barring public employers fro extending same-sex domestic partnership benefits.\n-MPIPP: The Michigan Project for Informed Public Policy (MPIPP) is an initiative of the Michigan Psychological Association Foundation to improve the lives of those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender by using psychological research to inform public policy.\n-Know Us Project: MPIPP also has developed a research-based educational project, the Know Us Project that shows LGBT people (and their allies) how to talk to others about the personal impact of social stigma and discrimination. The program uses experienced mental health professionals who can help participants recognize possible negative feelings and emotions that may be experienced during or after KUP conversations and learn to address them though self-care, stress management, and professional help if indicated.",

The assessment is an evaluation of their level of functioning which can be presented at their scheduled appeal hearing.\n-Helping Hands Place: This program grew out of concern for the lack of emergency and transitional housing for residents who are HIV positive and homeless.

    "Services Offered":"The program is a cooperative, interfaith, community-based effort to provide temporary overnight shelter to homeless men, women, and children (when accompanied by a parent or guardian). Guests may stay for up to 90 consecutive days while they seek a more permanent solution to their living situation.\n\nChristNet does not have any single location. Instead, it is hosted on a rotating basis, one week at a time, by various churches and community organizations throughout the Downriver and western Wayne County suburbs. Each church hosts our guests for seven nights, from Sunday evening through the following Sunday morning. Guests are driven away from the host church each morning and return each evening via our ChristNet van.\n\nThose staying overnight are offered a warm, clean place to stay, an evening meal, breakfast, and a bag lunch to go. Bedding consists of a mattress, pillow, sheets and pillowcase, and two blankets. Personal care items such as razor and shaving cream, soap, shampoo, toothbrush and tooth paste, etc. are offered. Some churches provide clothing. If a shower is available at the church guests are permitted to use it. Shower nights are scheduled at a nearby school gym or community building for those churches that do not have on-site showers.\n\nSince this is a rotating shelter, they have designated a specific location for intakes--24356 Eureka Road, Taylor, MI 48180.

The DBT program at CNS treats individuals with severe emotion regulation problems who are often chronically suicidal, may engage in self-harm behaviors and who have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.

We are able to fill nearly every medication prescribed. \n\nMedication Assistance Programs--With medication costs rising daily, it is important to use as many resources as possible to you to reduce your prescription costs.

We are here to help you understand what you may qualify for, how to apply, and how to use your medication assistance.\n\nFlexibility--This is perhaps our most valuable and unique traits that set us apart from other pharmacies.

Eight different areas of development are assessed: gross motor (large muscles), fine motor (how a child uses their fingers and hands), cognitive, speech, self care (eating and sleeping), emotions, interactions with others, and coping skills.\n\nThe first three years of life are critical for brain development and the optimum time for children to develop language skills, muscle coordination, and interpersonal skills. A developmental specialist will be assigned to your family based on your home location and your local school district. The evaluation will be completed in your home as we know children are more comfortable in their own surroundings. Parents are always present and participate by answering questions and providing support. A hearing and vision screening will also be completed. \n\nAssessment is important because 1) children with mild to moderate developmental delays that go undetected are likely to under-perform academically and 2) children with mild to moderate developmental delays that are not addressed grow up to have higher incidents of interpersonal conflicts and drug dependency, and have fewer skills to support themselves as adults.\n\nPARENTS AS TEACHERS--An in-home early childhood parent education and family support system.

Hours: Monday-Friday 7:30-3:30\n\nLIFETIME CARE--OPHS Physicians provide complete medical care for your entire family, from the care of newborns to the care of the family's oldest members. OPHS offers a full range of services from physical examinations and annual checkups to chronic disease management, acute medical care and family planning.\n\n-Pediatric Care: OPHS offers care of the newborn up through childhood with the emphasis on the growth and development of infants, children and teens. The importance of immunizations is stressed along with well child care. Our goal is to assist in providing the very best opportunity for the next generation to grow up healthy with good health habits that will last a lifetime.\n-Adolescent Care: Adolescence is a particularly challenging time in the development of young people. OPHS goes beyond the sports physicals that are common at this age to provide health care that involved the entire bio-psychosocial model. The needs of this age of transition from child to adult are complicated but are all focused preparing adolescents for a healthy future. OPHS works in conjunction with Pontiac School District Teen Health Centers at Pontiac High School and Madison Middle School, and the Waterford Intermediate School District Teen Health Center at the Waterford Alternative School.\n-Adult Care: OPHS provides care to adults in all of their specific needs including health screenings, immunizations and management of Chronic Illnesses such as diabetes and lung disease.\n-Geriatric Care: We change as we grow older. OPHS recognizes these changes and that the older individual has a different set of concerns/priorities, different beliefs, and different needs than those of adults. We stress the prevention of disease for our geriatric patients even more than before and immunizations are on of our most critical tools. OPHS also incorporates services designed to assist the older individual in maintaining their independence, whether it is remaining healthy with the appropriate immunizations and care of disease or to deal with the normal life cycle changes such as menopause, OPHS team members are here to support you. \n\nMEDICAL SERVICES--In addition to our quality primary and preventative health care services, OPHS offers several specialized medical services including:\n-School and Sports Physicals: It is important that children entering school have the best chance to succeed. The school physical provides an evaluation of the young student with the opportunity to assess the physical health and development of the child. Also, it gives our staff the opportunity to ensure that your child has been given all the immunizations they need to stay healthy. Oakland County is blessed with many good athletes and students and we are honored to help ensure they stay healthy by providing comprehensive physicals.\n-Immunizations: Immunizations are a proven and effective means of maintaining the health of each client at all stages of the life cycle, from infants to seniors. OPHS makes use of the Michigan Care Improvement Registry as well as evidenced based guidelines to deliver immunizations in the most effective manner possible. \n-Pregnancy Testing: The Infant Mortality Rate in Oakland County amongst medically underserved populations is 6 times the country average. It is important that women that are pregnant know as soon as possible and that they are provided access to prenatal care and prenatal vitamins as soon as possible. OPHS offers pregnancy testing to community members at a discounted rate for those that do not have the ability to pay. In addition, OPHS will assist these patients in finding an obstetrical care provider to insure the health of their newborn.\n-Pre-Employment Services: Employers have a keen interest in keeping their workforce healthy, this often begins with a pre-employment physical and OPHS is proud to offer this service to our community. Continuing care at OPHS gives employees the support structure they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and when sickness does occur the means to get well and return to work sooner.\n\nENABLING SERVICES--Life can be tough. Often a physician's appointment and a prescription are not enough; a patient needs a guide, someone to help them get access to the services they need to maintain their health. \n-Outreach: There are many people in our community that are not aware of the resources that are offered by OPHS and other community service organizations. The overall role of outreach workers is to work in the community to educate members regarding the availability of services. At OPHS we also endeavor to increase the \"healthy literacy\" of our community by providing services such as screening tools and multilingual resources to empower people with the tools and knowledge they need to be an active, healthy citizen. Other activities include working with the case managers and physicians to arrange transportation and other services for patients at OPHS.\n-Prescription Assistance: There are many patients that may not be able to afford the medicines that their physicians has prescribed for them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. OPHS has trained personnel dedicated to helping patients obtain these medications using pharmaceutical industry programs as well as those offered through other agencies. \n\nHEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCES--OPHS is proud to accept most public and private health insurance plans including those listed below.

The didactic groups cover such topics as: disease concept, spirituality, coping techniques, motivation, recovery process, thinking errors, relapse process and prevention, denial, cross addiction, 12-steps, and self-awareness. \n\n-Specialty Groups: Specialty groups consist of one to five interactive sessions per topic, each session approximately 90 minutes in length. Each session involves the clientï¿½s active participation in a structured learning activity. \n\n-Individual Therapy: Individual therapy is provided at least once a week in Intensive Outpatient. Individual therapy sessions generally last approximately 60 minutes. They may also take the form of conjoint or family sessions.\n\nMEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTï¿½Sacred Heart provides innovative, non-traditional outpatient medication-assisted opiate treatment programs that are integrated into greater health and wellness oriented services for adult men and women, including opiate dependent pregnant women. The Sacred Heart outpatient medication-assisted opiate treatment program incorporates the use of medication into a comprehensive, individualized treatment plan which attempts to enable each client to achieve the highest level of functioning and, ultimately, to live drug-free.  Sacred Heart uses a best practice model which combines the extensive use of cognitive behavioral therapy supported through the extensive use of motivational enhancement practices and the reward system inherent in the 12-Step fellowship. The treatment regimen consists of individual and group therapies, didactics, opiate specific education, medication administration and support. The administration of methadone will occur daily for each client until take home privileges have been qualified or earned. Clients will also be encouraged toward a methadone-free recovery as they demonstrate the strength, support and desire to do so. As with our other services, we discourage the fostering of dependency on any form of therapy beyond itï¿½s useful value.",

Depending on the nature of the drug of choice, the pattern of use and the medical history of the client, withdrawal can be traumatic to critical body functions and systems. We can treat the symptoms of withdrawal in a safe environment that is equipped and staffed for the effective management of those symptoms. At our Richmond campus and our Serenity Hills program, we offer a variety of detoxification services. These locations offer physician-directed, sub-acute detoxification units with nursing and laboratory support and specialized opiate (including methadone at our Richmond campus) detoxification. In addition to medical services provided during detoxification, these clients will have access to our residential treatment services. Clients will have access to a certified therapist who will conduct group therapy, individual therapy and interactive group didactics covering a variety of topics. A therapist will also meet with the client to discuss continuum of care options. Residential treatment orientations are also offered to detoxification clients whom are moving onto the next level of care, to ensure a comfortable transition. \n\nMEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTï¿½Sacred Heart provides innovative, non-traditional outpatient medication-assisted opiate treatment programs that are integrated into greater health and wellness oriented services for adult men and women, including opiate dependent pregnant women. The Sacred Heart outpatient medication-assisted opiate treatment program incorporates the use of medication into a comprehensive, individualized treatment plan which attempts to enable each client to achieve the highest level of functioning and, ultimately, to live drug-free.  Sacred Heart uses a best practice model which combines the extensive use of cognitive behavioral therapy supported through the extensive use of motivational enhancement practices and the reward system inherent in the 12-Step fellowship. The treatment regimen consists of individual and group therapies, didactics, opiate specific education, medication administration and support. The administration of methadone will occur daily for each client until take home privileges have been qualified or earned. Clients will also be encouraged toward a methadone-free recovery as they demonstrate the strength, support and desire to do so. As with our other services, we discourage the fostering of dependency on any form of therapy beyond itï¿½s useful value.",
